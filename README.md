## BRT Fin Designer

- BRT fin designer was created to allow those within amateur rocketry to quickly and easilly design rocket fins. The software was built around automatic design and therfore does not rely on the user's knowledge of underlying engineering theory. The software can however be used purely as an analysis tool if the user wishes.
- No formal educational background is required to use the tool
- The tool is free to use and always will be
- The software was written with collaboration in mind. If you're interested in collobrating, please email me at elliotjs.robinson@gmail.com. Having a background in Aerospace Engineering would be helpful but is by no means required.
